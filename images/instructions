When you get home, remember to do the following:
    1. Design a mock-up of the page you are responsible for
    2. Post an image of your mockup on our slack channel for review
    3. Clone the repository (you can use the command below):
        a. git clone https://github.com/KelynPNjeri/StackOverflow_lite-Phoenix.git
        b. cd StackOverflow_lite-Phoenix
    4. Position yourself at the UI branch (checkout the UI branch using the command below):
        a. git checkout UI
    5. Create a new branch for the page you are going to make: (ASSUMING I am to work on index.html)
        a. git checkout -b ft-index-page
    6. Once you have checked the feature branch (ft), start working on your file
    7. When you are ready, push the files to github for us to review:
        a. git add . 
        b. git commit -m "give your commit a message"
        c. git push --set-upstream origin ft-index-page   [remember to change ft-index-page with your branch name]
        d. Create a pull request from github (let us know if you are stuck at this stage so that we assist you)

Dont hesitate to inform us if you are stack at any stage,
HAPPY CODING,
